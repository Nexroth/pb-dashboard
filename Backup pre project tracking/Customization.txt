# Customization Guide

## Custom Themes

### Create Your Theme
Settings → Theme → Custom

**5 colors to customize:**
1. **Background** - main dashboard color
2. **Section/Sidebar** - these match automatically
3. **Bookmark Cards** - individual card color

5. **Accent** - badges, buttons, underlines

The system auto-generates hover states and borders so everything looks cohesive.

### Theme Tips
